<h1>Call for Papers: Workshop on the Convergence of Large Language Models and Ontologies</h1>
    <h2>14th International Conference on Formal Ontology in Information Systems (FOIS 2024)</h2>
    <h2>Date: 08-09 July 2024 (online) and 15-19 July 2024 (Enschede, Netherlands)</h2>

    <h3>Workshop Overview</h3>
    <p>The rapid development and deployment of Large-Language Models (LLMs) has led to growing interest in leveraging ontologies and knowledge graphs to enhance LLM capabilities and address limitations. Combining the semantically rich architectures provided by ontologies and knowledge graphs with the generative strengths of LLMs promises to provide a path towards more explainable artificial intelligence systems, more trustworthy output, and a deeper understanding of vulnerabilities arising from integrated architectures. 
       This workshop, associated with a <a href="https://www.iospress.com/news/call-for-papers-ontologies-and-large-language-models">special issue of Applied Ontology</a>, is dedicated to exploring the convergence of knowledge representation and LLM strategies, design patterns, models, and benchmarks. We aim to bring together researchers, practitioners, and enthusiasts from industry, academia, and government in the interest of exploring possible convergence points and advancing each field.</p>
    <p>We invite submissions for our workshop focusing on the intersection of Applied Ontology and Large Language Models as part of FOIS 2024.</p>
