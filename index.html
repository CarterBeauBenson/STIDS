    <h3>Conference Overview</h3>
    <p>The Twelfth International Conference on Semantic Technology for Intelligence,
Defense, and Security (STIDS 2024) will be held 23 and 24, October 2024, with a
tutorial session preceding the main conference on, October 22 and a classified session
at a venue to be announced for those with TS/SCI clearances on October 25. STIDS
provides a forum for academia, government, and industry to share the latest applied
research, development, and application of semantic technology for defense,
intelligence, and security applications. Semantic technology is a fundamental enabler to
achieve greater flexibility, precision, timeliness, and automation of analysis and
response to rapidly evolving threats.</p>
    <h3>Conference Themes</h3>
    <p>This year the STIDS theme will be providing trustworthy advanced computing by
integrating semantic technologies, computer and data science, and analytics using
transdisciplinary teams.</p>
<p>The world is drowning in data. The volume, velocity, variety, and varying veracity are
undermining our ability to reliably use these data for generating reliable insight across
the intelligence, defense, and security communities. The magnitude of the challenge is
well beyond the capacity of unaided human reasoning to address. Machine reasoning
(artificial intelligence & data science) can perform only as well as the data they use to
inform them. Well integrated semantic technologies are a critical contributor to
advancing the state of the art and practice across the information sciences. Semantic
interoperability is critical to delivering decision makers secure computing, reliable
insights and AI based decision support.</p>
<p>STIDS 2024 will provide a forum for sharing emerging best practices, ongoing research
and development, and education on the current state of the and practice.</p>

<div class="submission-guidelines">
    <h3>Submission Guidelines</h3>
    <p>Submissions of technical papers or extended abstracts are welcomed. Each submission
will be evaluated for acceptability by at least two members of the Program Committee.
Decisions about acceptance will be based on relevance to the above topic list,
originality, potential significance, and clarity. Because all accepted papers are to be
presented at the conference, we will require that at least one of the submitting authors
must be a registered participant committed to attending STIDS 2024.</p>

<p>If you are interested in presenting or attending, please respond via e-mail to: carterbe@buffalo.edu.</p>
    <p>The EasyChair submission page can be found <a href="">here</a>.</p>
    <p>All papers accepted to STIDS 2024 will be presented during the conference and published in the conference proceedings, which will be available as a separate publication after the Conference.</p>
