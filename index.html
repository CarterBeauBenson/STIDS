        <h3>Conference Overview</h3>
        <p>The Twelfth International Conference on Semantic Technology for Intelligence, Defense, and Security (STIDS 2024) will be held 23 and 24, October 2024, with a tutorial session preceding the main conference on, October 22 and a classified session at a venue to be announced for those with TS/SCI clearances on October 25. STIDS provides a forum for academia, government, and industry to share the latest applied research, development, and application of semantic technology for defense, intelligence, and security applications. Semantic technology is a fundamental enabler to achieve greater flexibility, precision, timeliness, and automation of analysis and response to rapidly evolving threats.</p>

        <h3>Submission Guidelines</h3>
        <p>Submissions of technical papers or extended abstracts are welcomed. Each submission will be evaluated for acceptability by at least two members of the Program Committee. Decisions about acceptance will be based on relevance to the above topic list, originality, potential significance, and clarity. Because all accepted papers are to be presented at the conference, we will require that at least one of the submitting authors must be a registered participant committed to attending STIDS 2024.</p>
        <p>Submissions are accepted only in electronic format and must closely follow the US Letter version of the IEEE format for conference proceedings. For complete details and to download LATEX or MS Word templates, choose the US Letter size from the <a href="https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html">IEEEâ€™s Manuscript Template</a>. Technical papers must be between six and eight pages, including figures. Extended abstracts must be no longer than three pages. Submissions outside these limits will not be reviewed. In addition, papers that, at the time of submission, are under review for or have already been published in or accepted for publication in a journal or another conference will not be accepted to the STIDS conference.</p>

    <p>Additional Information and a formal call for papers to follow soon. We look forward to reinvigorating this important dialogue.</p>
